# Plex Playlist Manager

A tiny local web service for defining Plex music playlists in YAML, previewing matches against your Plex Music library, and syncing them idempotently.

## What it does

- Reads playlist definitions from `/data/playlists.yml`.
- Supports whole albums and individual tracks.
- Preserves the YAML item order and Plex album track order.
- De-duplicates tracks automatically.
- Previews every match before you sync.
- `strict: true` prevents any change if an item cannot be matched.
- Sync replaces the existing Plex playlist of the same name, making the YAML file the source of truth.
- Reads the Plex token automatically from a **read-only** mount of Plex's `Preferences.xml`; `PLEX_TOKEN` can be used instead.
- Includes a small browser editor at port 5051.

## Install into your existing media-stack

Assuming your compose file is in the directory that contains your other project directories:

```bash
cd /path/to/media-stack
git clone https://github.com/tpepels/plex-playlist-builder.git plex-playlist-manager
sudo mkdir -p /srv/plex-playlist-manager
sudo cp plex-playlist-manager/playlists.example.yml /srv/plex-playlist-manager/playlists.yml
```

Add the service from `docker-compose.snippet.yml` to your existing `services:` block, then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build plex-playlist-manager
docker compose logs -f plex-playlist-manager
```

Open:

```text
http://media-server:5051
```

(or use the server's IP address).

## Compose service

```yaml
  plex-playlist-manager:
    build:
      context: ./plex-playlist-manager
    container_name: plex-playlist-manager
    ports:
      - "5051:8000"
    environment:
      TZ: ${TZ}
      PLEX_URL: http://host.docker.internal:32400
      PLEX_LIBRARY: Music
      PLAYLISTS_FILE: /data/playlists.yml
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    volumes:
      - /srv/plex-playlist-manager:/data
      - /srv/plex/config:/plex-config:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Why `host.docker.internal`?

Your Plex container uses `network_mode: host`, so Plex listens on the Docker host at port 32400. This service runs on a normal bridge network and reaches the host through Docker's `host-gateway` alias. Nothing in the existing Plex service needs to change.

## YAML format

```yaml
playlists:
  Quiet Folk:
    strict: true
    items:
      - artist: Nick Drake
        album: Pink Moon
      - artist: Bob Dylan
        track: Moonshiner
        album: The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991
```

For an album, every track on the matched Plex album is added. For a track, `album` is optional but useful when Plex contains several recordings with the same title.

## Safety / behaviour

The service never edits tags or files. It only creates/deletes Plex playlist metadata.

A sync deletes an existing audio playlist with the exact same title and recreates it from YAML. Therefore do not manually curate a playlist that is also managed here: YAML should be its source of truth.

`strict: true` is recommended while setting up a playlist. Preview first; once all entries match, sync it. `strict: false` creates the playlist from the entries that did match and reports the missing entries.

## Token handling

Preferred setup: keep the supplied read-only mount:

```yaml
- /srv/plex/config:/plex-config:ro
```

The service reads `PlexOnlineToken` from:

```text
/plex-config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Preferences.xml
```

If you don't want to mount the Plex config, remove that volume and set `PLEX_TOKEN` in the environment instead.

## Health check

```bash
curl http://localhost:5051/api/health
```

Expected:

```json
{"ok":true,"server":"...","library":"Music","version":"..."}
```
